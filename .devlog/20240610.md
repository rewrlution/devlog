## Implementing Circuit Breakers

Applied learnings from GopherCon to improve our service resilience.

**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**
- Using hystrix-go library
- Protecting Stripe API calls
- Database connection protection
- Redis operation safeguards

**Configuration:**
- 50% error rate threshold
- 10-second timeout window
- 30-second recovery period

**Team Review:**
- Priya helped with the testing strategy
- Kevin reviewed the implementation
- Rachel approved the design

**Results:** Much better handling of downstream service failures. Our service stays responsive even when Stripe has issues.

**Mood:** Feeling like a more mature engineer. Applying conference learnings to real production systems is satisfying.
