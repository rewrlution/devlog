## Database Migration Challenges

Working on the database schema for subscription billing. Migrations are trickier than expected.

**New Tables:**
- subscriptions
- billing_cycles  
- subscription_items
- usage_records
- payment_attempts

**Migration Challenges:**
- Zero-downtime deployment requirements
- Backfilling data for existing customers
- Foreign key constraints with existing payment data
- Index creation on large tables

**Team Collaboration:**
- DBA Jennifer helped optimize the migration scripts
- Priya wrote comprehensive tests for data integrity
- DevOps Tom planned the deployment strategy

**Learning:** Database migrations in production are an art form. So many things can go wrong!
