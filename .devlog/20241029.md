## Halloween Production Incident ðŸŽƒ

Spooky day turned actually spooky when our payment service went down during peak hours.

**The Incident:**
- 14:30 PST: Payment success rate dropped to 23%
- 14:45 PST: Full service degradation
- 15:20 PST: Root cause identified
- 15:45 PST: Service restored

**Root Cause:** Memory leak in the new fraud detection module caused OOM kills across all instances.

**Response Team:**
- Me (incident commander - first time!)
- Priya (technical investigation)
- Alessandro (customer communication)
- DevOps Tom (infrastructure recovery)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Need better memory monitoring
- Gradual rollout for new features
- Faster rollback procedures
- Customer communication templates

**Personal Growth:** Leading an incident response was intense but I kept calm and coordinated well.

**Follow-up:** Writing detailed post-mortem and action items. No blame, just learning.
