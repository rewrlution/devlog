## Sprint Planning Day

Had our Q1 planning session today. Working with Sarah and Mike on the new user authentication service. 

**Tech Stack:**
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL for user data
- Redis for session management
- JWT for tokens

**Mood:** Excited but a bit overwhelmed with the scope. The deadline seems tight but doable.

**Blockers:** Still waiting for the security team to approve our JWT implementation approach.

**Learning:** Spent some time reading about OAuth 2.0 flows. The implicit flow is deprecated - good to know!
