## Back from Vacation - European Launch Prep

Back from a much-needed two-week vacation. Team made great progress on European launch!

**What Happened While I Was Gone:**
- Priya led the tax calculation integration
- Alessandro completed GDPR compliance review
- Rachel finalized the multi-currency database schema
- DevOps deployed EU infrastructure

**Catching Up:**
- 47 code reviews to process
- 12 architecture decision documents to read
- 3 new compliance requirements to understand
- 1 production incident (handled well by the team)

**Personal Growth:** Delegating and trusting the team while away. They exceeded expectations!

**European Launch:** Targeting September 15th. Everything looks on track.

**Mood:** Refreshed and excited to contribute to the final push. Vacation was necessary but glad to be back.
