## European Payment Methods Integration

Working with Alessandro to integrate European payment methods. Eye-opening week!

**Payment Methods Added:**
- SEPA Direct Debit (Germany, Netherlands)
- iDEAL (Netherlands)
- Bancontact (Belgium)
- SOFORT (Germany, Austria)

**Technical Challenges:**
- Each method has different flow patterns
- Webhook handling varies significantly
- Currency conversion timing matters
- Regulatory compliance per country

**Architecture Changes:**
- Payment method factory pattern
- Country-specific validation rules
- Localized error messages
- Compliance audit trails

**Learning:** European customers have very different payment preferences. What works in the US doesn't necessarily work in Europe.

**Collaboration:** Alessandro's knowledge is invaluable. Priya is picking up the European regulations quickly.
