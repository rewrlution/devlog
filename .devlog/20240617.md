## Subscription Billing Beta Launch

Soft launch of subscription billing to 100 beta customers. Nervous but excited!

**Beta Features:**
- Monthly and yearly plans
- Plan upgrades/downgrades
- Prorated billing
- Failed payment handling

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
- 23 active subscriptions created
- 2 plan changes (both upgrades!)
- 1 failed payment (retry successful)
- Zero critical errors

**Team Coordination:**
- Customer success team (Anna) handling beta feedback
- Priya monitoring the logs closely
- Support team (Mike) ready for any issues

**Personal Win:** My mentoring of Priya is paying off. She caught a subtle bug in the proration logic during testing.

**Next Steps:** Analyzing beta feedback for full launch preparation.
