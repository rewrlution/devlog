## Testing Strategy Session

Had a great discussion about testing our payment service. Critical to get this right.

**Testing Layers:**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests with Stripe sandbox
- End-to-end tests for payment flows
- Load testing for high volume

**Tools We're Using:**
- Go's built-in testing package
- Testify for assertions
- Docker for integration test environment
- k6 for load testing

**Team Input:**
- QA engineer Lisa suggested chaos engineering
- Kevin shared his experience with financial testing
- Rachel emphasized the importance of test data management

**Personal Growth:** Leading the testing strategy discussion. Feels good to contribute at this level.
