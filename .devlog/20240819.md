## Disaster Recovery Testing

Quarterly disaster recovery drill. Always nerve-wracking but essential.

**Scenarios Tested:**
- Primary database failure
- Stripe API outage
- AWS region failure
- Payment service complete outage

**Results:**
- Database failover: 45 seconds (target: 60s) ✅
- Stripe fallback: Manual process worked ✅
- Multi-region: 2 minutes (target: 5m) ✅
- Service recovery: 8 minutes (target: 10m) ✅

**Issues Found:**
- Monitoring alerts delayed during failover
- Some configuration not synced between regions
- Manual runbook steps outdated

**Team Response:** 
- DevOps Tom updating infrastructure automation
- Priya documenting the new procedures
- Alessandro reviewing compliance implications

**Personal Reflection:** These drills are stressful but build confidence. When real incidents happen, we're prepared.
