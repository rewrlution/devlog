## Database Schema Design

Collaborated with the DBA team (Jennifer and Carlos) to finalize our user tables.

**Progress:**
- Designed user, roles, and permissions tables
- Added proper indexing for email lookups
- Set up foreign key constraints

**Challenge:** Had a heated discussion about whether to use UUIDs vs auto-incrementing IDs. Went with UUIDs for better distributed system support.

**Wins:** 
- Schema review passed security audit
- Performance tests look good with 1M+ users

**Tomorrow:** Start implementing the user registration endpoint.
