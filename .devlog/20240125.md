## First API Endpoint Complete!

Shipped the user registration endpoint today. Feeling pretty good about it.

**Team:** Working closely with QA engineer Lisa for testing scenarios.

**Tech Highlights:**
- Input validation with Joi
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email verification flow
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Deployment:** Used our new CI/CD pipeline. Build took 8 minutes - need to optimize that.

**Mood:** Accomplished! This is why I love backend development.

**Side note:** Started reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" - mind blown by the CAP theorem discussion.
