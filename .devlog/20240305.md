## New Project Kickoff - Payment Service

Starting a new microservice for handling payments. Exciting but daunting!

**Team:**
- Lead: Rachel (she's amazing)
- Backend: Me and Kevin
- Frontend: Emma and new hire James
- DevOps: Tom

**Tech Stack Decision:**
- Go instead of Node.js (better for financial calculations)
- PostgreSQL with strict ACID compliance
- Stripe API integration
- Docker + Kubernetes deployment

**First Day Jitters:** Go is new to me. Spent the evening going through the Tour of Go. The concurrency model is fascinating.

**Goal:** MVP in 6 weeks. Ambitious but the team is confident.
