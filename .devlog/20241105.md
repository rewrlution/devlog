## Machine Learning for Fraud Detection

Starting a new project - implementing ML-based fraud detection. Exciting but challenging!

**Project Goals:**
- Reduce false positive rate from 12% to <5%
- Catch more sophisticated fraud patterns
- Real-time scoring (sub-100ms)
- Explainable decisions for compliance

**Tech Stack:**
- Python for ML model development
- TensorFlow for neural networks
- Go service for real-time inference
- Feature store for ML pipeline

**Team Expansion:** Hiring a data scientist (interviews next week).

**Learning Plan:**
- Online ML course (Andrew Ng's)
- Reading "Hands-On Machine Learning"
- Experimenting with fraud detection datasets

**Collaboration:** Working with data team to understand our transaction patterns.

**Challenge:** Balancing fraud prevention with user experience. False positives hurt legitimate customers.
