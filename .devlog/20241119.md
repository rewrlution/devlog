## Feature Engineering Deep Dive

Working with Maya on feature engineering for fraud detection. Fascinating process!

**Features We're Extracting:**
- Transaction velocity (frequency patterns)
- Geographic anomalies (unusual locations)
- Device fingerprinting (browser/mobile patterns)
- Behavioral patterns (time of day, amounts)
- Network analysis (connected accounts)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Real-time feature computation in Go
- Historical feature aggregation in Python
- Feature store using Redis + PostgreSQL
- Streaming pipeline with Kafka

**Interesting Discoveries:**
- Fraudsters often test with small amounts first
- Geographic velocity impossible for humans
- Device switching patterns are telling
- Time zone inconsistencies reveal VPN usage

**Personal Learning:** ML engineering is very different from traditional backend development. Data pipelines are complex!

**Challenge:** Balancing feature richness with inference latency. Some features are expensive to compute.
