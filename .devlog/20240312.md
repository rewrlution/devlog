## Go Learning Curve

One week into Go development. It's... different.

**Struggles:**
- Missing generics (this was before Go 1.18 adoption)
- Error handling feels verbose
- Package management still confusing

**Wins:**
- Compiled binaries are so fast!
- Goroutines make concurrent programming intuitive
- Static typing catching bugs early

**Pair Programming:** Kevin is a Go expert. Learning so much from him about idiomatic Go patterns.

**Progress:** Built the basic payment struct and validation logic. Tests are passing!

**Evening:** Watched some Go conference talks. The community seems really focused on simplicity and performance.
