## Monitoring and Observability

Post-launch week focused on monitoring our payment service in production.

**Monitoring Stack:**
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for dashboards  
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- ELK stack for log aggregation

**Key Metrics We Track:**
- Payment success rate (currently 99.2%)
- Response latency (p95: 180ms)
- Error rates by payment method
- Stripe webhook processing time

**Collaboration:** Working with SRE team (Maria and Chris) to set up proper alerting.

**Learning:** Distributed tracing is amazing for debugging payment flows across multiple services.

**Challenge:** Balancing detailed logging with performance. Too much logging slows things down.
