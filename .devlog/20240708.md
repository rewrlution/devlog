## International Payments Research

Starting research for international payment support. More complex than domestic payments!

**Requirements:**
- Support for EUR, GBP, JPY currencies
- Local payment methods (SEPA, iDEAL, etc.)
- Tax calculation and compliance
- Multi-region deployment

**Research Findings:**
- Stripe supports most of what we need
- Tax calculation requires third-party service (TaxJar)
- Currency conversion needs careful handling
- Regulatory compliance varies by country

**Team Expansion:** Hiring a payments specialist with international experience.

**Collaboration:** Working with legal team (Sarah) on compliance requirements.

**Learning:** International business is incredibly complex. So many regulations and edge cases to consider.
