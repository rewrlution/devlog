## Valentine's Day Deploy (Romantic, right?)

Deployed the password reset feature today. Team decided to work through the holiday to hit our milestone.

**New Features:**
- Email-based password reset
- Security questions as backup
- Account lockout after failed attempts

**Collaboration:** Worked with frontend team (Emma and David) to integrate the new endpoints.

**Tech Deep Dive:** Implemented JWT refresh tokens. Finally understand the security implications properly.

**Personal Win:** My code review feedback is getting more thoughtful. Senior dev Rachel complimented my attention to edge cases.

**After Work:** Grabbed dinner with the team. Good culture here - we support each other through crunch times.
