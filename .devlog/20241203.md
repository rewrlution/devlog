## Fraud Detection Model Training

Maya and I spent the week training our first fraud detection model. Results are promising!

**Model Performance:**
- Precision: 94.2% (vs 88% baseline)
- Recall: 89.7% (vs 76% baseline)
- False positive rate: 3.1% (vs 12% baseline)
- Inference time: 45ms (target: <100ms)

**Model Architecture:**
- Gradient boosting (XGBoost)
- 47 engineered features
- Ensemble with neural network
- Online learning capability

**Training Process:**
- 6 months of historical data
- Stratified sampling for class imbalance
- Cross-validation with time splits
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

**Production Readiness:**
- Model serving infrastructure in Go
- A/B testing framework ready
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- Rollback procedures documented

**Next Steps:** Shadow mode deployment next week to validate real-world performance.
