## Subscription Billing Architecture

Started designing the subscription billing feature with Priya. Complex but interesting problem!

**Requirements:**
- Monthly/yearly billing cycles
- Prorated charges for mid-cycle changes
- Failed payment retry logic
- Dunning management
- Usage-based billing support

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Event-driven design with message queues
- Separate billing engine service
- Cron jobs for recurring charges
- State machine for subscription lifecycle

**Team Brainstorming:** 
- Kevin suggested using temporal.io for workflow management
- Rachel emphasized the importance of audit trails
- Priya asked great questions about edge cases

**Personal Note:** Mentoring is rewarding. Priya's fresh perspective is helping me think differently about problems.
