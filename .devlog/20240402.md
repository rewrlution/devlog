## April Fools' Bug

Someone thought it would be funny to introduce a "harmless" bug yesterday. Not so harmless in production!

**The Bug:** Payment amounts were being divided by 100 instead of multiplied. $100 charges became $1 charges.

**Response:**
- Emergency rollback at 2 AM
- Incident post-mortem with the whole team
- New policy: no code changes on April 1st

**Lessons:**
- Even "harmless" pranks can have serious consequences
- Our rollback process worked perfectly
- Need better automated testing for currency calculations

**Team Dynamics:** The prankster (who shall remain nameless) bought lunch for everyone. All forgiven, but lesson learned.

**Technical:** Added more comprehensive integration tests for payment amounts.
