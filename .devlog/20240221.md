## Performance Optimization Week

Spent the day profiling our authentication service. Some interesting findings!

**Performance Issues Found:**
- Database queries were N+1 problem in user permissions
- Redis connections not being pooled properly
- JSON parsing happening twice per request

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Added eager loading for user roles
- Configured Redis connection pool
- Optimized middleware chain

**Results:** Response time improved from 200ms to 45ms average!

**Team:** Pair programmed with senior engineer Marcus. His debugging skills are incredible.

**Learning:** Discovered `clinic.js` for Node.js performance profiling. Game changer!
