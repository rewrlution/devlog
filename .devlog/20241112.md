## New Data Scientist - Dr. Maya Chen

Excited to welcome Dr. Maya Chen to the team! PhD in Machine Learning from Stanford.

**Maya's Background:**
- 5 years at Google working on fraud detection
- Published research on anomaly detection
- Expert in feature engineering
- Experience with production ML systems

**First Week Projects:**
- Analyzing our transaction data patterns
- Identifying key fraud indicators
- Designing feature engineering pipeline
- Setting up ML experimentation framework

**Collaboration Style:** Maya asks great questions about business context. She understands that ML is only as good as the problem definition.

**Learning from Maya:**
- Feature engineering is more important than algorithm choice
- Data quality matters more than data quantity
- A/B testing is crucial for ML systems
- Interpretability vs accuracy tradeoffs

**Team Dynamics:** Having a domain expert changes everything. We're asking better questions about what fraud actually looks like.
