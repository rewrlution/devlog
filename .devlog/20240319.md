## Stripe Integration Deep Dive

Spent the day integrating with Stripe's payment APIs. More complex than expected!

**Challenges:**
- Webhook signature verification
- Handling payment intent states
- Idempotency for retry scenarios
- Currency conversion edge cases

**Team Collaboration:**
- James (frontend) helped with the payment flow UX
- Rachel reviewed my webhook handler code
- Security team (David) audited our PCI compliance approach

**Technical Win:** Implemented proper webhook handling with exponential backoff for retries.

**Mood:** Frustrated with the complexity but excited about learning financial systems.

**Note:** PCI compliance is no joke. So many security considerations I never thought about.
