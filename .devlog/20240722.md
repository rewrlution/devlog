## Performance Optimization Sprint

Week-long sprint focused on optimizing payment service performance.

**Bottlenecks Identified:**
- Database connection pooling inefficient
- JSON serialization happening too often
- Unnecessary API calls to Stripe
- Memory leaks in long-running goroutines

**Optimizations Implemented:**
- Upgraded to pgxpool for better connection management
- Added response caching for frequently accessed data
- Implemented Stripe data caching with Redis
- Fixed goroutine lifecycle management

**Results:**
- Response time: 120ms â†’ 65ms (46% improvement)
- Memory usage: 30% reduction
- Database connections: 80% more efficient
- Throughput: 2x increase

**Team Effort:** Everyone contributed. Priya found the memory leak, Rachel optimized the database queries.
