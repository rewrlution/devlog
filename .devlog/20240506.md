## New Team Member Onboarding

We have a new backend engineer joining the team - Priya! Fresh from university but very sharp.

**Onboarding Plan:**
- Week 1: Environment setup and codebase walkthrough
- Week 2: Small bug fixes and code reviews
- Week 3: Feature development with mentoring
- Week 4: Independent work on subscription billing

**My Role:** Acting as her mentor. First time in this position - exciting and nerve-wracking.

**Day 1 Activities:**
- Showed her our Git workflow
- Explained the payment service architecture
- Set up her development environment
- Introduced her to the team

**Reflection:** Teaching someone else really tests your own understanding. Had to explain Go interfaces much more clearly than I understood them myself!
