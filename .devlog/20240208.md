## Production Bug Hunt

Rough day. Found a critical bug in production that's affecting user logins.

**Issue:** Race condition in our Redis session handling when multiple requests hit simultaneously.

**Team Response:**
- Emergency call with DevOps (Tom and Alex)
- Sarah helped with the hotfix
- Mike handled customer communications

**Solution:** Added proper locking mechanism using Redis SETNX.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Need better load testing for concurrent scenarios
- Our monitoring needs improvement
- Always test edge cases

**Mood:** Stressed but learned a lot. These production fires teach you more than any tutorial.
