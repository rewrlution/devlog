# Sync Feature - MVP Implementation

## Overview

The sync feature enables devlog entries to be synchronized with cloud storage providers. The current MVP implementation provides a foundation for future cloud provider integration while offering immediate functionality through a local file system provider.

## Current Implementation Status ✅

### What's Implemented

1. **Core Architecture**
   - `CloudStorage` trait with async support using `async-trait`
   - Modular provider system for future extensibility
   - Configuration management with TOML files
   - CLI commands for sync operations

2. **MVP Provider: Local File System**
   - Simulates cloud storage by copying files to `~/.devlog/sync`
   - Safe testing environment before adding real cloud providers
   - Validates the entire sync architecture

3. **Sync Operations**
   - **Push**: Upload local changes to "cloud" (sync directory)
   - **Pull**: Download remote changes to local
   - **Sync**: Bidirectional sync (push + pull)
   - **Status**: Show current configuration and sync state

4. **Configuration**
   - Default config at `~/.devlog/config.toml`
   - Home directory preference (`~/.devlog/entries` for local entries)
   - Expandable for future cloud provider credentials

5. **Safety Features**
   - **No file deletion** - only adds and updates files
   - Last-modified-time conflict resolution
   - Comprehensive error handling with `color-eyre`

## Usage

### Initialize Sync
```bash
devlog sync init
```
Creates `~/.devlog/config.toml` with default settings.

### Check Status
```bash
devlog sync status
```
Shows current provider, sync directory, and connection status.

### Sync Operations
```bash
devlog sync push    # Upload local changes
devlog sync pull    # Download remote changes  
devlog sync sync    # Bidirectional sync
```

## File Structure

```
src/
├── sync/
│   ├── mod.rs          # CloudStorage trait and core types
│   ├── config.rs       # Configuration management
│   └── engine.rs       # SyncEngine and LocalProvider
└── commands/
    └── sync.rs         # CLI command handlers
```

## Configuration Example

**`~/.devlog/config.toml`**:
```toml
provider = "local"
sync_dir = "~/.devlog/sync"
```

## Dependencies Added

- `tokio` - Async runtime for file operations
- `toml` - Configuration file parsing  
- `async-trait` - Async trait support for dynamic dispatch

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Cloud Providers (Next)
- Azure Blob Storage implementation
- AWS S3 implementation
- Credential management and validation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Error recovery and retries
- Progress reporting for large syncs

### Phase 3: Production Features
- Background sync
- Incremental sync
- Bandwidth optimization
- Multi-device coordination

## Architecture Benefits

### Future-Proof Design
- **Provider Agnostic**: Easy to add Azure, AWS, Google Cloud
- **Modular**: Each component can be enhanced independently
- **Testable**: Mock providers for comprehensive testing
- **Configurable**: Settings can evolve without code changes

### Safety First
- **No Data Loss**: Never deletes files automatically
- **Conflict Resolution**: Deterministic last-modified-wins strategy
- **Rollback Capable**: Can implement transaction-like behavior later
- **Validation**: Input validation prevents corruption

## Technical Details

### Conflict Resolution
- Compare file modification timestamps
- Newer file always wins (overwrites older)
- Preserves modification time when downloading
- No manual merge required

### File Discovery
- Scans `~/.devlog/entries` for `.md` files
- Recursive directory traversal
- Relative path preservation in cloud storage
- UTF-8 filename validation

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error propagation with `color-eyre`
- Network failure resilience (future)
- Graceful degradation on partial failures
- Clear user feedback and error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Current Testing
- Compilation verification
- Basic CLI command testing
- Configuration file generation
- Status reporting validation

### Planned Testing
- Unit tests for each sync operation
- Integration tests with mock cloud providers
- Performance testing with large file sets
- Multi-device sync simulation
- Network failure recovery testing

## Migration Path

The MVP implementation provides a clear migration path for users:

1. **Start with local sync** to validate workflow
2. **Add cloud provider** by updating config
3. **Existing data preserved** during provider migration
4. **Incremental adoption** of advanced features

This approach minimizes risk while providing immediate value and ensuring the architecture can scale to full cloud sync capabilities.
